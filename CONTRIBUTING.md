# Contributing guidelines
Everyone is welcome to work on this library.
Please be sure to read the rules of conduct before contributing, since these will also apply when you're contributing.

# Rules
* Be sure to comment on the changes that you've made (e.g. I have improved the performance of writing logs)

That's it (for now)!

# General coding style
Please try to follow the general coding style that is already commited in this library.
While the var keyword is great to speed up development, we generally don't like them. This is just a coding style. Rest assured though, that
pull requests will not be denied because of them.

We will, however, deny pull requests if they contain dead code or generally unoptimized code. Be sure to give your variables a propper and meaningful name.
Code that is well documented is always a plus!
